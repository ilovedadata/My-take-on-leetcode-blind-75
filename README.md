# My-take-on-leetcode-blind-75

This repo contains some Python code I wrote in order to learn something more about algorithms and data structures. 

The questions I answered can be found at https://leetcode.com/. My sources to do so, i.e. my "masters" have been Timothy H Chang and Neetcode, whose code can be found on their youtube channel.
The goal I set before taking on this challenge was to improve my understanding of big O notation, algorithms and data structures. 

As I solve new problems, I will add the solutions to them in this repo. Some of them will not be from the blind 75 list, but they will be added nonetheless if they proved to be great for my learning of the aforementioned topics.
