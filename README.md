# My-take-on-leetcode-blind-75

This repo contains some Python code I wrote in order to learn something more about algorithms and data structures. 

The questions I answered can be found at https://leetcode.com/. My sources to do so, i.e. my "masters" have been Timothy H Chang and Neetcode, whose code can be found on their youtube channel.
The goal I set before taking on this challenge was to improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures skills.
